Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        An inline-block element is placed as an inline element (on the same line as adjacent content), but it behaves as a block element.
        A block element has some whitespace above and below it and does not tolerate any HTML elements next to it.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
        An element positioned absolutely uses the nearest ancestor or parent as it's position. If there is no parent, it will simply use the doc. 
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        Display Block Elements:
            1. <div>
            2. <li>
            3. <nav>
        Display Inline Elements:
            1. <button>
            2. <textarea>
        Display Inline-Block Element:
            1. <select>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 

        Every element in HTML has a box model.
        This box model is made up of a few different properties: Margin, Border, Padding
        These properties surround the content of the element and allow us to build and transform the element with CSS.
